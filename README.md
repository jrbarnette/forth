A Forth interpreter
===================
This is an implementation of a Forth interpreter in C, targeting
conformance with ANSI X3.215-1994 (ANS Forth).

The source is available under the terms of the GNU General Public
License, v2.0.  See the LICENSE file.

Purpose
=======
This is done entirely for my own amusement, without any expectation
that it will serve any practical purpose.  Really, I just want to see
what a Forth interpreter looks like when I write it.
