Where we are:
    Have source that can compile Forth into direct-mode code in C;
    it generates the content for bootstrap/initdict.c.

    The compilation includes COMPILE-INPUT, in host/compile.fth.
    So, we have a custom interpretation loop, which we need for
    compilation to handle literals and Forth compilation state.

Next steps:
    Extract INTERPRET-NAME, INTERPRET-NUMBER, and INTERPRET-UNKNOWN
    from target/internal/interpret.fth, and rewrite them for
    direct-mode compilation.  Use that to add meta-mode compilation,
    or whatever else we pick.

My current thinking on what to do is in host/direct/meta-notes.txt.

My current hold-up is discovering complexity in writing definitions
when standard words (esp. [ and ]) depend on the current search
order.
