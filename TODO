See this trick:
    { define_name, "+LOOP",	x_plus_loop, NAME_TYPE_COMPILE },
    { compile_name, "UNLOOP" },

Have a compile_name, but for xt functions.  Can use it for most
anonymous xt literals; only skip/fskip are compiled from more than
one compiling definition.
====
Add something to convert stdforth.fth to a C string, and compile
it into the interpreter.  The interpret the string for
initialization.  For extra credit, get rid of the main
interpretation loop by making the last call in the string be QUIT
