If an error occurs after ':' starts, and before ';' completes, what do
we need to do to restore state?
  * Reset HERE back to its prior value.
  * Anything else?


variable defn-reset
: start-name ( hdlr "name" -- name )
    parse-name check-name-length
    here dup defn-reset ! aligned
    header, ;


: : here defn-reset ! handler: do_colon start-name ] ;

: reset-dict defn-reset @ here - allot ;

How do we determine when we need to do this?
  * Basically, if QUIT gets control after an exception.
  * ? is that really the long and short

... Ties in with RECURSE: need to be able to find the current definition
unambiguously (not from the stack).
  * In RECURSE, we just compile he current definition.
  * For an error, need to check if the current definition is still open.
  * Need to have ; mark that the current definition is closed.

So

variable curdef
0 curdef !

: : hdlr-colon start-name curdef ! ] ;
: ; postpone EXIT curdef @ ?dup if link-name 0 curdef ! then
    [compile] [ ; compile-special
: RECURSE curdef @ name>xt compile, ;
: :NONAME align here hdlr-colon , [compile] ] ;

... :NONAME wouldn't work w/ RECURSE as shown above; need two
different variables:
  * start of current definition's name
  * xt of current defintion

... all of the existing code that assumes there's something on
the stack during :-definition needs to be adjusted :-(
