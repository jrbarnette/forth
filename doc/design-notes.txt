direct-threaded interpreter
    easy to construct Forth in C
    slower
two-token interpreter
    separate "interpret" and "compile" tokens
    might make more sense with direct threaded
    elegant
vm assembler
    easier to construct dictionary
    more Forth-coded definitions
    looks like duplicated work
support for save/restore dictionary
    a useful feature
    more Forth-coded definitions
    a nuisance to do indirect threaded
native-code assembler
    this is where to go
    a lot of annoying details
    a lot to bite off at once?
more Forth in Forth
    also where to go
    the interesting bits
    not testable w/o the other work
