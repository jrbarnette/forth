HOST
    Basic utilities for output to target code

META-HOST
    Host stuff that can't be shared with BUILDER, such as:
	INTERPRET and constituents
	COMPILE-FILE:
	' (redefined to search META-BUILDER only)
	local helpers, see build-defs:
	    parse-valid-name
	    augmented do-literal, ?branch, branch
		(?) maybe could/should be META-BUILDER
	    expr-literal, et al.
	    xt-literal
	    operand-cell
	    control utilities, e.g. <?BRANCH et al., DO-EPILOG

META-TARGET
    Definitions that can be compiled to target builder, and compiler
    special definitions for building them.  Everything needed to
    implement the BUILDER primitives:
	meta-initialize
	do-literal
	linkname
	meta-addname
	meta-startname
	meta-setflags
	meta-compile
	meta-interpret
	meta-reference

META-DEFINERS
    Extension of HOST to contain/redefine key words, especially
    defining words.  Exists to support adding definitions into
    META-BUILDER.  At minimum, these:
	PRIM:
	:
	CONSTANT
	VARIABLE
	]

META-SPECIAL
    meta-builder compiler special definitions that need to override
    standard definitions when compiling what is otherwise HOST or
    META-HOST code.  Currently that means POSTPONE (and nothing else).

    (Consider including [COMPILE] and ['])

TARGET
    Vocabulary (-ies?) to support BUILDER target code source
