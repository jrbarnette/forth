From the standard, "input source specification" means the collection of
the following information
  * "input source": When BLK is not 0, the indicated block. Otherwise,
    the source indicated by the value of SOURCE-iD.
  * Input buffer, as returned by SOURCE.
  * Parse area, as determined by >IN.

In theory, the full specification is known by something like this:
(When the Block word set is present)
  SOURCE >IN @ SOURCE-ID BLK @
(When the Block word set is not present)
  SOURCE >IN @ SOURCE-ID

However, SOURCE may be a function of SOURCE-ID.  Additionally, in the
current implementation, every buffer has two sizes:  The current size
(the number of bytes returned by the last read), and the maximum size
(the number of bytes allocated in storage)

Calculating the parse area:
    SOURCE >IN @ - >R >IN @ + R>

    SOURCE >IN @ SWAP OVER - >R + R>

    SOURCE >IN @ TUCK - >R + R>
