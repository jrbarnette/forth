primitives:
    memory:
	!  @ C! C@ MOVE
    arithmetic:
	+ - 2* 2/ < <> = > AND INVERT LSHIFT NEGATE OR RSHIFT U< U> XOR
    stack:
	>R ?DUP DEPTH DROP DUP OVER R> R@ ROT SWAP
	2SWAP 2OVER
    execution:
	EXECUTE EXIT
	ABORT
	CATCH THROW
    dictionary:
	address of HERE
	head of current name list?
    internal:
	for private xt's: skip fskip do-literal do-s"
	machine primitives: mcp-: mcp-constant mcp-create mcp-variable
    terminal I/O
    file I/O

non-primitive:
    something for parsing
    something for to identify cell and char sizes
	ALIGNED CELL+ CELLS CHAR+ CHARS
    compilation state
	[ ]
    names
	'
    allocation
	, C, ALLOT
    names for machine code primitives (at least internal ones)

possibly only function is to append to dictionary?
    backward references to named objects
    forward and backward relative references (e.g skip targets)
    multiple data types
	numbers
	references
	characters
	machine-code references
