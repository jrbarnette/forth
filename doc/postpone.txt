text defining POSTPONE
    Append the compilation semantics of name to the current
    definition.

text defining [COMPILE]
    If name has other than default compilation semantics, append
    them to the current definition; otherwise append the execution
    semantics of name.

N.B. The text means that something like the below are equivalent:
    POSTPONE LITERAL
    [COMPILE] LITERAL

These are different:
    POSTPONE SWAP
    [COMPILE] SWAP
--
the standard has two categories of definition:
    standard semantics:
      + in interpretation state, execute directly, so long as
	interpretation is allowed
      + in compilation state, append execution semantics
    special compilation semantics:
      + not allowed in interpretation state
      + defined compilation semantics

so, POSTPONE looks like this
    if word has special compilation semantics
	compile the special compilation semantics
    else
	compile code that compiles the target definition's execution semantics

and [COMPILE] looks like this
    if word has special compilation semantics
	compile the special compilation semantics
    else
	compile the target definition's execution semantics

but for [COMPILE], both special and standard semantics boil down
to the xt out of FIND, so [COMPILE] becomes
    compile the target definition's xt

put another way
    : [COMPILE] ' compile, ; immediate \ no-interpret
