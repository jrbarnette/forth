TARGET compilation state:
    search order:
	TARGET-COMPILE
    name in TARGET-COMPILE vocabulary:
	execute the definition
    number
	execute LITERAL from TARGET-COMPILE vocabulary
    unknown
	lookup name in target dictionary
	if not found
	    error
	if immediate
	    error
	compile to target dictionary as a label

TARGET interpretation state:
    search order:
	HOST
	FORTH
    some entries in HOST need to shadow FORTH vocabulary
    maybe need something special for TARGET?  e.g. to make this work:
	variable LEAVERS 0 leavers !
    ... or could just handle this as direct code in initialize_forth.
