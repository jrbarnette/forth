---- Raw dict generation
TARGET compilation state:
    search order:
	HOST-COMPILE
	TARGET
    name in HOST-COMPILE vocabulary:
	execute the definition
    name in TARGET vocabulary:
	if immediate
	    error
	compile to target dictionary as a label
    number
	execute LITERAL from HOST-COMPILE vocabulary
    unknown
	error

TARGET interpretation state:
    search order:
	HOST-INTERPRET
	FORTH
    some entries in HOST-INTERPRET need to shadow FORTH vocabulary
    maybe need something special for TARGET?  e.g. to make this work:
	variable LEAVERS 0 leavers !

    ! C!
	maybe need to customize?
