---- Raw dict generation
TARGET compilation state:
    search order:
	HOST-COMPILE
    name in HOST-COMPILE vocabulary:
	execute the definition
    number
	execute LITERAL from HOST-COMPILE vocabulary
    unknown
	lookup name in TARGET vocabulary
	if not found
	    error
	if immediate
	    error
	compile to target dictionary as a label

TARGET interpretation state:
    search order:
	HOST-INTERPRET
	FORTH
    some entries in HOST-INTERPRET need to shadow FORTH vocabulary
    maybe need something special for TARGET?  e.g. to make this work:
	variable LEAVERS 0 leavers !
    ... or could just handle this as direct code in initialize_forth.

	COMPILE,
	    COMPILE, is a wrapper for LABEL,
    name definition:

	    create in target dictionary
	    compile handler for do_colon
	    enter TARGET compilation state
	CONSTANT VARIABLE
	    create in target dictionary

	    allocate cell in target dictionary
	CREATE
	    create in target dictionary
	    compile handler for do_create
	    .. but maybe not viable in host interpret state?

    name alteration
	IMMEDIATE, et al.
    name lookup:
	' FIND lookup
    state-related
	[ ]
    @ ! C@ C! (... maybe also MOVE FILL)
	maybe need to customize?
