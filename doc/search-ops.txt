search operations (search list methods)
    name, ( c-addr u -- )
    set-flags ( flags == )
    lookup ( c-addr u -- ptr flags )

but the real goal is to associate a ptr with xt values
... how many?  which one?

so
    lookup ( c-addr u -- xt flags )

issue is two different callers:
    QUIT just wants to execute something based on STATE
    FIND just wants to give the caller the facts
