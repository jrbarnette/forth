Values for SOURCE-ID

Reading from terminal - QUIT:
    SOURCE-ID is 0
    BLK is 0
    input buffer is TIB, the user terminal input buffer
    user buffer holds at least 80 characters
    \ comments until end of buffer
    ( parses until end of buffer
    control characters may match blank delimter

Reading from string - EVALUATE:
    SOURCE-ID is -1
    input buffer is string
    \ comments until end of string
    ( parses until end of string
    control characters may match blank delimter

Reading from block - LOAD THRU:
    BLK is non-zero block number
    SOURCE-ID is 0
    input buffer is the block in BLK
    \ comments until end of line
    line length for \ is implementation-defined
    ( parses until end of block
    control characters may match blank delimter

    lines can have at least 128 characters
    \ comments until end of line
    ( parses until end of file
    control characters must match blank delimiters
